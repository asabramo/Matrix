The Story
---------
This is my first useful Android project. I made it for my daughter, after I learned "just enough" about Android to get started.
I can't say this is my best work, but it's a nice game and it is effective - she plays it and learns through it.
When we started she was about 3 years old and the game was teaching her to match colors and shapes.
Then I added some Hebrew letters and words, and she learned from that.
Then I added English letters and words and she's learning from that.
She's now almost 7 years old.
The audio recordings are her voices.

The Game
--------
The game itself is an implementation of the well known (at least in Israel) educational board game called "Ma Bamishbetzet", 
which is Hebrew for "What's in the square?". I named my project Matrix, coz it sounds cooler...
But essentially this game is a game of fitting things into the right place in the matrix.

Technical Details
-----------------

I'm using Java with Eclipse, so far using Android SDK version from 2013 - I haven't upgraded since I started the project.
I am using the app on my Nexus 5X (Nougat) and also on my Nexus 10 (Kit-Kat?).
The addition of the images seems to increase the size of the app so my emulator fails to load it at the moment. 
I picked the images at random and didn't bother about their size, maybe I should. But anyway, on real devices it works, 
so I guess it's not that big.


Known Issues
------------

1. When orientation changes, the game is reset
2. My young son is able (and happy) to pull cards out of the screen so that they cannot be recovered.
